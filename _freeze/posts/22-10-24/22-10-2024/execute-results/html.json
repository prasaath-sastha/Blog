Side note: The tidy Tuesday repository gets updated with a new data set every Tuesday, and people all around the world use this data to produce some awesome visualization and shiny apps.\n\nThis is the first dataset I am working on, and I am writing this quarto markdown as I go along. I have come across a lot of data scientists that do this in a R script to produce a plot or a graphic. And to me, I choose to do this in a markdown format, because I simply love the quarto platform. I am a big notion person, like half my life is on notion. So, using quarto with all the markdown and code execution functionality is like Disney land to me.\n\nApologies if I am boring you, since this is my first post I am just going over what happening in my head at this time. This blabber will not be present on the future posts.\n\nSo lets get started, the data we are going to read and work on are released on [22 OCT 2024](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024/2024-10-22).\n\nThe libraries that I would like to use on any R project for efficiency are\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\"}\n# Load libraries\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) # This is a collection of packages that is used for data exploration, wrangling and plotting.\nlibrary(tidytuesdayR) # This package is used to connect to the tidy Tuesday repo for the data\n\n# Library that plays a hige role in improving test plot aesthetics\nlibrary(glue) \nlibrary(ggtext) \nlibrary(showtext)\n\n# Libraries for Maps\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(sf)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow the `tidytuesdayR` package helps us access the data set that is present in the git hub repo.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntuesdata <- tt_load(\"2024-10-22\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n---- Compiling #TidyTuesday Information for 2024-10-22 ----\n--- There is 1 file available ---\n\n\n── Downloading files ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n  1 of 1: \"cia_factbook.csv\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncia_factbook <- tuesdata$cia_factbook\n\nglimpse(cia_factbook)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nRows: 259\nColumns: 11\n$ country                 <chr> \"Russia\", \"Canada\", \"United States\", \"China\", …\n$ area                    <dbl> 17098242, 9984670, 9826675, 9596960, 8514877, …\n$ birth_rate              <dbl> 11.87, 10.29, 13.42, 12.17, 14.72, 12.19, 19.8…\n$ death_rate              <dbl> 13.83, 8.31, 8.15, 7.44, 6.54, 7.07, 7.35, 7.3…\n$ infant_mortality_rate   <dbl> 7.08, 4.71, 6.17, 14.79, 19.21, 4.43, 43.19, 9…\n$ internet_users          <dbl> 40853000, 26960000, 245000000, 389000000, 7598…\n$ life_exp_at_birth       <dbl> 70.16, 81.67, 79.56, 75.15, 73.28, 82.07, 67.8…\n$ maternal_mortality_rate <dbl> 34, 12, 21, 37, 56, 7, 200, 77, 51, 97, 540, N…\n$ net_migration_rate      <dbl> 1.69, 5.66, 2.45, -0.32, -0.15, 5.74, -0.05, 0…\n$ population              <dbl> 142470272, 34834841, 318892103, 1355692576, 20…\n$ population_growth_rate  <dbl> -0.03, 0.76, 0.77, 0.44, 0.80, 1.09, 1.25, 0.9…\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nUsing glimpse we can see that the data set has 259 observations over 11 variables. On a superficial view, it appears that the data set contains variables such as area, birth rate, death rate, and so on with respect to each country.\n\nNow, since we have come to an understanding that each of the variable is associated with a country, we can go on start making basic structure for how we are going to analyze or visualize the data.\n\nAfter this step, I would like to examine each of the variable by summarizing or plotting to see if there are any null values or extreme outliers that needs to be evaluated further. Since all the variables except the country are numbers or doubles there are a list of things I like to check before proceeding\n\n-   Missing values and their representation\n-   Negative values (appropriateness)\n-   Minimum and Maximum (context specific)\n-   Data format\n\nIf it is a categorical variable, i always check for duplicates, and similar names.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncia_factbook |>\n    ggplot(aes(area))+\n    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_bin()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Computation failed in `stat_bin()`.\nCaused by error in `bin_breaks_width()`:\n!
