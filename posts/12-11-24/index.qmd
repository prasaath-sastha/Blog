# An attempt on creating an interactive plot

This weekâ€™s **Tidy Tuesday** challenge (2024-11-12) provided an excellent opportunity to explore country datasets through the lens of ISO Alpha-3 and numeric codes. Using the `countries` dataset from the repository, I created a clean and interactive world map visualization that showcases the geographic and numeric diversity of nations. Below, I walk you through the process and the insights gained.

### **Dataset Overview**

The dataset includes three main components:

1.  **Countries**: Information on modern countries, including ISO codes (Alpha-2, Alpha-3, and numeric), names, and additional metadata.

2.  **Country Subdivisions**: Details about smaller administrative regions within countries.

3.  **Former Countries**: Historical countries that no longer exist, offering a fascinating look at geopolitical changes.

For this visualization, I focused on the **`countries`** dataset to build an interactive map.

### **The Visualization**

The goal was to highlight how ISO Alpha-3 codes and numeric codes can help represent countries visually. Using the `plotly` library, I created an **interactive choropleth map**. Each country is shaded based on its numeric ISO code, with hoverable tooltips providing details such as the country name.

Key features of the map include:

-   **ISO Alpha-3 Codes**: These codes are used to pinpoint countries on the map.

-   **Color-Free Design**: To keep the map simple and focused, I disabled the color legend, ensuring the visualization remains clean and distraction-free.

-   **Custom Layout**: The map uses an equirectangular projection with clean coastlines and unobtrusive white borders for better readability.
